			<p><em>Update (2025): I came across this travel report in my archives – originally written for the Organists Off Topic mailing list. While rather dull as far as travelogues go, it documents an experience shared by thousands of Norwegian millenials, rounding off their mandatory ten years of schooling with the long bus ride from Norway to the Nazi concentration camps, following the trails of the &ldquo;white buses&rdquo; that brought survivors home towards the end of the war.</em></p>
<p><em>(More trivially, it documents how my written English has hardly improved in the two decades since I dropped out of school.)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We left Kleppe at 03:30 AM, September 10, 2004. The four classes had been divided into two groups, as there were two buses to ride and two hotels booked in at Krakow, our destination. We arrived in Kristiansand well before the Denmark ferry was to leave. The morning was cold and clear.</p>
<p>I was one of the very few who had never visited Denmark before – it&rsquo;s an extremely popular destination for Norwegians, especially in the summer. My experience with Denmark was nice, although a little limited, as all we did was to drive through the whole country, from Hirtshals in the north, to København (Copenhagen) in the south-east. We passed the extremely impressive Storebælt bridge, connecting the islands of Fyn and Sjælland on our way, and finally arrived in &ldquo;Køben&rdquo; around 8 PM.</p>
<p>My Polish-born classmate seemed somewhat sceptical about the boat, named &ldquo;Pomerania&rdquo;, but it turned out to be quite nice. We had &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; (a sausage with fries) onboard, had some fun exploring the boat, and went to bed. I think most of us got to sleep, but when we entered German territory in the middle of the night, the GSM network operator was kind enough to send a welcome message! A lesson learned for those who didn&rsquo;t switch off their phones &hellip;</p>
<p>The following morning we arrived in Swinoujscie, AKA Swinemunde. We were gracefully let into the country by a heavily armed guard, and began our drive for Krakow. After a few hours we stopped in the not-quite-so-charming village of Sulechow, to have dinner at a place called &ldquo;Motel Texacana&rdquo;. I thought the meat was quite good, it was the gravy that was too penetrating — little did I know that I was eating wild boar for the first time of my life! Others knew more than me and seemed to dislike it rather seriously ;-)</p>
<p>We finally arrived in Krakow some 43 hours after we left Kleppe. My group was to stay at &ldquo;Hotel Start Kapelanka&rdquo;, the other group at &ldquo;Motel Krak&rdquo; (what a name!). 100 meters from the hotel was a huge &ldquo;Tesco&rdquo; mall, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As the prices in Poland are generally one third of what they are in Norway, this quickly became a popular place to waste time and money.</p>
<p>Not much sleep the first night in Krakow, as we had to get up before 07:00 to have breakfast. Then we once again boarded the coaches and set off for Oswiecim, better known by its German name Auschwitz. We were guided in four groups, unfortunately with four bad guides. Most of us were not used to hear English spoken with a Polish accent, very quickly and very quietly, and much of the guide talk was difficult to understand.</p>
<p>I had read a lot about the concentration camps and WW2 in general, and had some ideas of what to expect. Auschwitz I was almost smaller than I had imagined, but when we entered Auschwitz II &ldquo;Birkenau&rdquo;, it was so large I almost couldn&rsquo;t believe it. 1-2 million Jews and other &ldquo;lower races&rdquo; were exterminated here&hellip; It&rsquo;s very difficult to describe what I felt with words. All I can say is that if you haven&rsquo;t already — go see it for yourself. It will be unlike anything you&rsquo;ve experienced before.</p>
<p>We woke up the next morning to a fantastic day, equally full of positivity as the day before had been full of horrors. The famous salt mines of Wieliczka! That&rsquo;s some of the most impressive I&rsquo;ve seen so far in my short life. 100–150 meters below ground level, room after room with sculptures carved in salt all over the place. A chapel and a huge cathedral! I almost didn&rsquo;t miss an organ at all ;-) Simply marvellous. After a most fascinating tour with an excellent guide, we safely got up to ground level by a scary elevator ride. One of the adults remarked; &ldquo;This is just like Disneyland, except for being really dangerous!&rdquo;. No wonder this is a UNESCO world heritage!</p>
<p>After this we were transported back to Krakow and got to spend a couple of hours exploring its wonders. I was sure to visit every church I saw — they were plentiful to say the least — unfortunately without any of the organs being used. I did get to hear organ music though; at the old city wall sat what looked like a music student and played some kind of accordeon, giving a virtuosic performance of the Bach D minor!</p>
<p>At 17:00 we went to Hotel Pollera to have dinner, followed by a &ldquo;folklore evening&rdquo; with a Krakowian band. Lots of traditional dances and folk songs were performed over and over, with enormous enthusiasm. It was a little to much for me, but people seemed to have great fun.</p>
<p>The beginning of the end came the following day, as we got up at 5:30 and somehow managed to get onboard the coaches. Again many, many, hours of driving, a few stops underway including an encore of the infamous Sulechowie dinner, before arriving in Swinoujscie late in the evening. Back in Copenhagen the following morning we took a different route home, as the fast ferry to Norway didn&rsquo;t have enough space for our large bus. Thus I got to visit Sweden for the first time in 14 years! Driving, driving, driving. It&rsquo;s quite OK when you have your friends around you, to play card games or just chat. We arrived at home at 03:00 the following day. The end of a truly great trip!</p>
