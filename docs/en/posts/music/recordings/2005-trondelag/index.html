<p>Not many pre-school teachers colleges sport a pipe organ, but this one does, thanks to its past life as a special school for the blind. It probably sounds quite a bit better in its current glass building than it did in the gym hall where it used to stand. (According to my father who attended the school in the early 1970s, removing pipes from the organ was a popular pasttime among the pupils.)</p>

<p>This church is home to a magnificent organ built by the local firm Br. Torkildsen, and newly installed at the time of the recording.</p>

<p>Thanks to Espen Selbæk, Nils Petter Svendsen Aune, and Jon Kristian Fjellestad for great fun and showing me these instruments and more in the Trondheim region.</p>
